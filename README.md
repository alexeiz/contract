# Lib.Contract #

Library to support contract programming in C++11 and later.

## Overview ##

Contract programming (also known as design by contact) allows to reduce
programming effort and produce more robust code especially in large projects.
Contracts are usually expressed in the form of preconditions, postconditions
and invariants.  Some programming languages have built-in support for
contracts.  C++ is not one of them.  In C++ contracts can be approximated with
assertions.  But assertions suffer from the lack of expressiveness and
consistency.  Lib.Contract library is intended to improve contract programming
in C++ by providing a way to express contracts in a direct, descriptive and
consistent way.

## Quick start ##

Lib.Contract is a header-only library.  You can copy the headers and
use it immediately without building the library (but if you want to build and
run tests, see section "Building and running tests").  Here's a small and
complete example of the library in action.  It defines a function with a
contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition.

    #include <contract/contract.hpp> // Lib.Contract library header

    #include <cstddef>      // for size_t
    #include <cstring>      // for strlen

    std::size_t my_strlen(char const * str)
    {
        std::size_t len = 0;

        contract(fun)      // defines the contract for this function
        {
            precondition(str, "invalid argument");
            postcondition(len == std::strlen(str), "incorrect return value");
        };

        for (char const * p = str; *p; ++len, ++p)
            ;

        return len;
    }

    int main()
    {
        my_strlen("abc");    // all good: contract checks pass
        my_strlen(nullptr);  // error: precondition is violated
    }

The above function, `my_strlen`, has a contract with a precondition that
requires the input parameter `str` to be non-NULL and a postcondition that
ensures that the return value is correct.  The precondition is checked on
function entry and the postcondition is checked on function exit.  Notice,
however, that both precondition and postcondition are defined in the same
block, `contract(fun)`, at the beginning of the function.

## Library documentation ##

To use the Lib.Contract library the following header file needs to be included:

    #include <contract/contract.hpp>

It provides several macros that facilitate contract programming:

    contract(type) { /* contract block */ };

> Defines a contract block of a specific `type`, where `type` can be one of the
> following:
>
> * `fun` for function contract,
> * `this` for method contract,
> * `class` for class contract,
> * `derived` for derived class contract,
> * `ctor` for constructor contract,
> * `dtor` for destructor contract,
> * `loop` for loop invariant.

The contract block is just a regular block of code that should contain contract
checks.  The following contract checks are available: precondition,
postcondition and invariant. All contract checks are defined in a similar way:

    precondition(cond [, message]);

> Defines a precondition.

    postcondition(cond [, message]);

> Defines a postcondition.

    invariant(cond [, message]);

> Defines an invariant.

The `message` parameter for contract checks is optional.

Contract checks can be defined one or more times inside the contract block.
Usually, preconditions are checked on entry (to a function, method, etc),
postconditions are checked on exit and invariants are checked on both entry and
exit.  However, there can be some exceptions in which contract checks are not
enforced.  See the description of individual contract blocks below for more
information.

### Function contract ###

A function contract block should be defined inside a free function using the
following syntax:

    contract(fun)
    {
        precondition(<precond-expr> [, <message>]);
        invariant(<inv-expr> [, <message>]);
        postcondition(<post-expr> [, <message>]);
    };

The `invariant` contract check is usually not needed in the function contract
block unless a function needs to maintain some global invariant.

The function contract block enforces contract checks according to the following
rules:

* the precondition expression is always checked on entry to a function,
* the postcondition expression is checked on exit unless the function is
  exitted with an exception,
* the invariant expression is always checked on entry and exit.

### Method contract ###

A method contract block should be defined inside of a method of a class.  It is
similar to a function contract block, but it also provides an additional
capability of enforcing class contracts.  The syntax for the method contract
block is the following:

    contract(this)
    {
        precondition(<precond-expr> [, <message>]);
        invariant(<inv-expr> [, <message>]);
        postcondition(<post-expr> [, <message>]);
    };

See the class invariant contract block description for details on how the
method contract blocks can enforce class invariants.

The method contract block enforces contract checks according to the following
rules:

* the precondition expression is always checked on entry to a method,
* the postcondition expression is checked on exit unless the method is exitted
  with an exception,
* the invariant expression is always checked on entry and exit.

### Constructor constract ###

A constructor contract block should be defined inside of a constructor of a
class.  It is similar to a method contract block with some exceptions.  The
syntaxt for the constructor contract block is the following:

    contract(ctor)
    {
        precondition(<precond-expr> [, <message>]);
        invariant(<inv-expr> [, <message>]);
        postcondition(<post-expr> [, <message>]);
    };

The `invariant` contract check is usually not needed in the constructor
contract block unless the constructor needs to maintain some global invariant.

The constructor contract block enforces contract checks according to the
following rules:

* the precondition expression is always checked on entry to a constructor,
* the postcondition expression is checked on exit unless the constructor is
  exitted with an exception,
* the invariant expression is always checked on entry and exit.

### Destructor constract ###

A destructor contract block should be defined inside of a destructor of a
class.  It is similar to a method contract block with some exceptions.  The
syntaxt for the destructor contract block is the following:

    contract(dtor)
    {
        precondition(<precond-expr> [, <message>]);
        invariant(<inv-expr> [, <message>]);
        postcondition(<post-expr> [, <message>]);
    };

The `invariant` contract check is usually not needed in the destructor contract
block unless the destructor needs to maintain some global invariant.

The destructor contract block enforces contract checks according to the
following rules:

* the precondition expression is always checked on entry to a destructor,
* the postcondition expression is checked on exit unless the destructor is
  exitted with an exception (strictly speaking, this should not happen;
  throwing destructors are bad),
* the invariant expression is always checked on entry and exit.

### Class invariant contract ###

A class contract block should be defined inside a class.  It defines the
invariant contract for the class.  The syntax for the class contract block is
the following:

    class MyClass
    {
        // ...

    private:
        contract(class)
        {
            invariant(<inv-expr> [, <message>]);
        };

        // ...
    };

A class contract block can also contain precondition and postcondition checks,
but those are not enforces (ignored).

There can be only one class contract block for a given class.

The class invariant contract is enforced according to the following rules:

* it is checked on entry and exit to every method of the class that has a
  method contract block.  The method contract block can be empty, such as
  `contract(this) {};`.
* it is not checked on entry to class constructors with a constructor contract
  block, `contract(ctor)`, but checked on non-exceptional exit of constructors
  (the class invariant only needs to hold if a constructor succeeds),
* it is checked on entry to a class destructor with a destructor contract
  block, `contract(dtor)`, but is not checked on exit of the destructor (the
  class invariant doesn't need to hold for a destructed object).

### Derived class invariant contract ###

A derived class contract block is intended to be defined in a class derived
from one or more base classes with a class invariant contract.  It defines the
invariant for the derived class and also enforces invariants of the base
classes.  The syntax for the derived class contract block is the following:

    class MyClass : public Base1 [, public Base2, ..., public BaseN]
    {
        // ...

    private:
        contract(derived)(Base1 [, Base2, ..., BaseN])
        {
            invariant(<inv-expr> [, <message>]);
        };

        // ...
    };

The behavior of the derived class contract block is identical to the class
contract block with the exception that all base class invariants are also
enforced.

### Loop invariant contract ###

A loop invariant contract block is a special contract block for enforcing loop
invariants.  It should be defined inside a loop.  The syntax for the loop
invariant contract block is the following:

    contract(loop)
    {
        invariant(<inv-expr> [, <message>]);
    };

Precondition and postcondition contract checks inside a loop invariant contract
block are not enforced (ignored).  The invariant contract check is checked on
every iteration of the loop.

### Handling contract violations ###

When a contract is violated by not satisfying any of its contract conditions,
the following function is called to handle the contract violation:

    namespace contract
    {
        [[noreturn]]
        void handle_violation(violation_context const & context);
    }

Where `contract::violation_context` struct is defined as follows:

    namespace contract
    {
        enum class type
        {
            precondition,
            postcondition,
            invariant
        };

        struct violation_context
        {
            contract::type contract_type; // type of the failed contract check macro
            char const * message;         // message passed to the contract check macro
            char const * condition;       // condition of the contract check
            char const * file;            // file in which the contract check occurs
            std::size_t line;             // line on which the contact check occurs
        };
    }

By default `handle_violation` prints a message to `std::cerr` with the
information about the contract violation and then aborts the execution by
calling `std::terminate`.

The behavior of `handle_violation` can be customized by providing a different
violation handler function via `set_handler` and `get_handler` library
functions:

    namespace contract
    {
        using violation_handler = std::function<void (violation_context const &)>;

        violation_handler set_handler(violation_handler new_handler);
        violation_handler get_handler();
    }

The custom handler is supposed to be `[[noreturn]]` like the default handler.
If the custom handler returns, `std::terminate` is called anyway.  However the
custom handler can throw an exception, which can be used in test code to ensure
that contracts are defined properly.

## Building and running tests ##

Lib.Contract uses the waf build system.  The simplified build/install
process with waf looks like this:

    # in the root directory of the repo
    $ tools/waf configure          # configure the build (--prefix=PREFIX for installation prefix)
    $ tools/waf build              # build library and run tests
    $ tools/waf build --notests    # build without tests
    $ tools/waf install            # install headers using the specified prefix (default /usr/local)

Run `tools/waf --help` for more configuration and build options.  Waf requires
Python 2.6 or later.

## Requirements ##

* Python 2.6 or later.
* G++ 4.8 or later or Clang 3.3 or later.  If compiled with Clang, libc++
  library may also be required.
* Boost version 1.50 or later is required to compile and run tests.

## Limitations ##

* The library works only in C++11 mode on resonably modern C++ compilers.
* The contract of a virtual function of a base class overriden in a derived
  class is not checked.  The derived function has to duplicate the contract of
  the base class function.
